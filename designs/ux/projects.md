# Projects
When a user wants to get an in-depth look at my skills, and the software I build they should take a look at my projects. 
For this reason a page should be added where the user can find my projects and go to my github profile.

My best projects should be displayed at the start, and more clearly than the others.

# Flow

```plantuml
@startuml

:user opens home page;
:user sees projects button;
:user navigates to projects screen;
:user sees 2 biggest projects, with a list of technologies and a description;
:user scrolls down;
:user sees more projects, with a list of technologies;
:user clicks on a project;
:user is redirected to github in a new window;
end
